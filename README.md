# Magento Media Cleanup Module
Magento isn't removing product images automatically. So in time your product image directory may grow up incredibly and become a mess. This module allows you to match images in your media directory with images linked to products in your database and remove unused ones. You can run cleanup either manually or via cron.

# Compatibility
* Magento CE 1.8-1.9

# Installation
* Disable compilation
* Merge app/ dir of the module package with app/ dir of your magento installation
* Refresh magento cache, relogin to admin panel

# Usage
Go to **System > Configuration > EasyMage > Media Cleanup**
